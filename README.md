## 1. Retrieve PrivateKey/seedphrase for zkSync
First we'll need a privateKey for all deployment needs of Smart Contracts to `zkSync`:
We shall:
1. Add zkSync to MetaMask
2. Retrieve privateKey of zkSync as you would with Ethereum on MetaMask

### 1. Adding zkSync to MetaMask

Method 1 : Adding zkSync Manually

To use zkSync Era, add the network to MetaMask. Here’s how:

    Log in to MetaMask.
    Click the network bar in the top left.
    Choose “Add network” from the menu.
    In the form that pops up, fill in the following accordingly:
    -Network Name: zkSync Era Mainnet
    -RPC URL: https://mainnet.era.zksync.io
    -Chain ID: 324
    -Currency Symbol: ETH
    -Block Explorer URL: https://explorer.zksync.io/
    After clicking ‘Save’, you can use the zkSync network through MetaMask. To switch, click the dropdown beside the network name at the top left of your wallet and select zkSync.

Method 2 : Adding `zkSync` via Chianlist web app:
This can be done by following these steps:

1. Connect with MetaMask
2. Visit https://chainlist.org/ and connect your MetaMask wallet.
3. Search for “zkSync” using the search bar.
4. Click “Add to MetaMask” to automatically include verified zkSync Era information to your extension.
